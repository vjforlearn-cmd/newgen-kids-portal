  <h1>Our Programs</h1>
  <p>Our programs are designed in accordance with Maryland family child care guidelines to support children’s social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development. 
    Through consistent routines, active supervision, and age-appropriate learning experiences, we provide a safe, nurturing setting where children feel secure, 
    supported, and ready to learn.</p>

      <h3>Infant Care: A Foundation of Trust & Developmental Growth</h3>
      <p>
        "At The NewGen Kids, our infant program is strictly aligned with Maryland’s COMAR regulations and Early Learning Standards to provide the highest level of care for your little one."
             - Safe Sleep & Comfort: We adhere to Maryland’s strict Safe Sleep practices. Every infant has an individual, MSDE-approved crib with firm, flat surfaces to ensure safety and peace of mind during rest periods.
             - Responsive Feeding: Following Maryland health standards, we maintain individualized feeding schedules updated every three months. We are a breastfeeding-friendly program and support mothers in their feeding choices with proper storage and handling.
             - Early Learning Domains: Our daily activities are guided by the Maryland Early Learning Standards (0-18 months). We focus on:
             - Physical Well-Being: Supervised tummy time to build motor skills.
             - Language & Literacy: Constant verbal interaction, reading, and music to spark early communication.
             - Social-Emotional: Consistent 1-on-1 bonding to foster a secure "second home" attachment.
             - Healthy & Safe Environment: Our home is regularly inspected to meet all Maryland health, safety, and fire codes. We maintain a low 1:3 ratio (per COMAR standards) to ensure your infant receives the immediate, personalized attention they deserve.

      <h3>Toddler Discovery: Building Independence & Connection</h3>
      <p>
        "Our Toddler Program is designed to bridge the gap between curiosity and capability. Rooted in the Maryland Early Learning Standards, we provide a structured yet flexible environment where toddlers learn to navigate their world with confidence."
             - Fostering Self-Help Skills: We encourage Maryland’s 'Healthy Beginnings' milestones by supporting toddlers in learning to feed themselves, wash their hands, and begin the potty-training journey when they show readiness—building a sense of pride and autonomy.
             - Language & Literacy Immersion: To meet Maryland’s communication standards, we fill our day with 'Serve and Return' interactions. From storytime to labeling emotions, we help toddlers expand their vocabulary and express their needs clearly.
             - Social-Emotional Foundations: Using the Pyramid Model (a Maryland favorite), we teach toddlers how to share, take turns, and identify feelings. Our small group setting provides the perfect 'laboratory' for these first vital friendships.
             - Active Physical Play: Our indoor and outdoor environments are designed for 'Purposeful Play.' Whether it’s strengthening gross motor skills on our safe outdoor equipment or fine motor skills through art and sensory bins, children are constantly learning through movement.
             - Safety & Ratios: We maintain strict Maryland COMAR compliance for toddler-to-provider ratios, ensuring every child is supervised and supported during this high-energy stage of development.

      <h3>Preschool Readiness: Confidence for the Road Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        "Our Preschool Readiness program is intentionally designed to ensure your child excels in the Maryland Kindergarten Readiness Assessment (KRA). We blend high-level academic concepts with the social maturity required for a successful transition to Maryland Public Schools."
             - Emergent Literacy & Phonics: Following the Maryland Early Learning Standards, we go beyond the alphabet. We focus on phonemic awareness, print concepts, and storytelling, sparking a lifelong love for reading and communication.
             - Mathematical Thinking: We move from counting to "number sense." Through hands-on manipulatives, children explore Maryland’s core math concepts: sorting by attributes, identifying patterns, and early addition/subtraction through play.
             - Scientific Inquiry & Problem Solving: We encourage "The Scientific Method" for four-year-olds. Whether it’s observing the life cycle of a butterfly or building complex block structures, children learn to ask questions, test theories, and persevere through challenges.
             - Executive Function & Classroom Routines: School success depends on "Learning to Learn." Our daily rhythm mirrors a kindergarten classroom, helping children master multi-step directions, self-regulation, and the transition between independent and group activities.
             - A "Whole Child" Approach: While we focus on academics, we prioritize the Maryland standard of Social-Emotional Competence. We ensure children graduate our program not just knowing their letters, but knowing how to be a kind friend and a confident leader.
